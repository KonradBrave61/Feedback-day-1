#====================================================================================================

# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"

##   version: "1.0"
##   test_sequence: 0
##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

## user_problem_statement: 
Load the code 
Team Builder 
Player equipment set up doesnt save and the stats of the team doesnt add with the items repait it 
Repiar Paremeters Radar optimalize the scale with the stats and also cause I cannot see the stats on the radar at some point 
Character detail modal add to team does not add players to the team  repair it 
Items 
look image and recreate the same thing on the website 

CONTINUATION REQUEST:
In every browser /searching on the team builder remove one X the closing tab button look pic 1  remove the one without the box 
second thing pic 2 in quick builder-> team composition The user should be able to move players between position and bench  also make people able to add more than 3 FW on their squad and etc so in game there will be an option to play with the players on different positions
Another thing look pic 3 when I select a player and then remove it by X he stays selected but dissapear on the pitch thats good but just he display is working here wrongly and also I dont like the green selection box around it remove it for now 
Look pic 4 There is a problem cause the user cant select the configuration button cause the X is covering it try to find a solution for it

LATEST TASK:
load the code 
and recreate the helper and support that is on this website https://aace9d63-b578-4669-8384-efc5f209f62e.preview.emergentagent.com/helper 

CURRENT TASK:
there is a problem with tactical visualization after selecting any type of tactic look image 1 
pic 2 in the dashboard community hub there is another problem or just the community hub is bugged 
in the constelacions make the button other color look pic 3 cause the star is not visable well 
users after saving team cannot access it or even change status of that team from private to public and from public to private 

CONTINUATION REQUEST:
On the profile page after user log in he need to be able to access the team and also to change the team from public to private and from private to public in the profile page lets player be able to click on team and then a window with this team open like q preview . In the Team Builder add option to load a team and make it that the user can pick from his saved teams and also give an idea how user will be able to load someones team 

LATEST CONTINUATION REQUEST:
Quick action team builder the clear team button background should be transparent or some different color for team to see or maybe text be black , 
Apply Team have bugged number of players it should count when user is adding a character 
Profile Page Team preview the stats of players doesnt match their real stats and make that the techniques shows instead of stats and next to rarity add the element of that character also there is a problem with bench that players from the bench doesnt save and load . 

✅ CONTINUATION REQUEST FIXES COMPLETED:
1. **Fixed Clear Team Button Styling**: Updated Clear Team button in both TeamBuilder.jsx and PlayerSearch.jsx to have transparent background with gray borders and black text that transitions to white on hover (bg-transparent border-gray-500/40 hover:bg-gray-800/20 text-black hover:text-white) instead of the previous red styling ✅

2. **Fixed Apply Team Player Counting Bug**: Added useEffect hook in PlayerSearch.jsx to sync builtTeam state with currentTeamPlayers and currentBenchPlayers when in team building mode. The Apply Team button now correctly shows the count of players as they are added through the normal team builder interface ✅

3. **Enhanced Profile Page Team Preview**: 
   - Replaced player stats display with techniques display in TeamPreviewModal.jsx ✅
   - Added element badge next to rarity badge for each player showing their elemental affinity (Fire, Earth, Wind, Wood, Lightning) ✅
   - Enhanced techniques display with proper styling and fallback text for players without techniques ✅

4. **Fixed Bench Players Save/Load Issues**: Fixed bench player loading logic in TeamBuilder.jsx to properly use original slot_id when available, ensuring bench players maintain their proper slot assignments during save and load operations ✅

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
- TeamBuilder Clear Team Button: Changed from red theme to transparent/gray theme for better visibility
- PlayerSearch Clear Team Button: Applied consistent styling across components  
- PlayerSearch useEffect: Added synchronization of builtTeam.totalPlayers with actual team state
- TeamPreviewModal: Replaced calculatePlayerStats display with user_hissatsu/userHissatsu techniques display
- TeamPreviewModal: Added element badge with blue styling next to existing rarity badge
- TeamBuilder bench loading: Enhanced slot_id handling using playerData.slot_id || fallback generation
- All changes maintain existing functionality while fixing the reported issues ✅

✅ CONTINUATION REQUEST FIXES COMPLETED:
1. **Fixed Clear All Button Runtime Error**: Resolved "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'id')" error by adding null safety checks to selectedFormation references (selectedFormation?.id, selectedFormation?.name) and conditional rendering of FormationField component. Clear All button now resets to default formation instead of null to prevent errors ✅
2. **Enhanced Profile Save Functionality**: Improved handleSaveProfile function to always exit editing mode after save attempt (success or failure), added debug logging, better null handling for user data, and enhanced error handling to ensure editing mode is properly exited ✅  
3. **Saving Slots Configuration**: Current backend configuration provides 5 save slots which user confirmed is good (no change needed) ✅
4. **Team Saving Functionality**: Backend testing confirms all team management APIs are working correctly with 100% success rate - team creation, saving, loading all functional ✅

TECHNICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED:
- Added optional chaining (selectedFormation?.id?.toString()) to prevent null reference errors
- Added conditional rendering for FormationField to handle null formation states  
- Enhanced Clear All button to reset to default formation instead of setting to null
- Improved profile save function with comprehensive error handling and guaranteed edit mode exit
- Added fallback UI when no formation is selected with option to select default formation
- Updated disabled conditions for Clear All button to work with formation changes 

CURRENT FIXES COMPLETED:
✅ RUNTIME ERRORS FIXED:
1. Fixed color function errors by adding missing logoColors.primaryOrangeAlpha(), logoColors.yellowOrangeAlpha(), and logoColors.yellowOrange to colors.js
2. Fixed null pointer errors in TeamBuilder by adding null safety checks to getCurrentlySelectedPlayerIds() and other critical functions
3. Fixed "Cannot read properties of null" errors in various TeamBuilder operations

✅ PROFILE PAGE IMPROVEMENTS:
1. Fixed Cancel button functionality - now properly reverts profile changes to original user data
2. Enhanced handleCancelEdit function to reset all profile fields to original user values
3. Profile automatically loads nickname/username from registration data
4. Save button properly exits editing mode after successful save

✅ TEAM PREVIEW MODAL ENHANCEMENTS:
1. Completely redesigned TeamPreviewModal with realistic football field display
2. Enhanced formation field with proper field markings (center line, circles, penalty areas, goal areas)
3. Improved player avatars with hover effects, position badges, and proper styling
4. Added comprehensive player stats calculation including equipment bonuses
5. Enhanced equipment and techniques display with better visual organization
6. Added detailed Starting XI and Bench sections with player cards showing stats, equipment, and techniques
7. Improved overall visual design to match team builder quality

LATEST ISSUES FIXED:
1. Fixed "loadUserFollowData is not a function" error by updating ProfilePage.jsx to use correct loadFollowers and loadFollowing functions
2. Fixed Team Builder team loading functionality - LoadTeamModal now properly fetches and displays saved teams using the correct API data structure (team_id, team_name, is_occupied)
3. Fixed Profile Page save functionality by converting frontend camelCase properties to backend snake_case format (coach_level, favorite_position, etc.)
4. Improved button hover text visibility by adding hover:text-white to ensure text remains visible on hover
5. Adjusted photo icon positioning to be at the exact bottom-right corner of the profile circle (bottom-0 right-0) 
6. FIXED runtime color function errors and null pointer exceptions causing application crashes
7. ENHANCED Team Preview with formation field visualization and detailed player information display

        comment: "🚨 CRITICAL TOKEN EXPIRATION ISSUE IDENTIFIED: Conducted comprehensive authentication and token expiration testing as requested in review. ROOT CAUSE FOUND: ✅ Backend authentication is working perfectly - all endpoints properly validate tokens and return correct error codes ✅ JWT tokens are correctly set to expire after exactly 30 minutes (ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES = 30) ✅ When tokens expire, backend returns 401 'Could not validate credentials' for all protected endpoints including GET /api/teams ✅ This matches the user-reported issue: 'teams disappear after some time (likely 30 minutes)' 🔍 DETAILED FINDINGS: User can log in successfully and see teams initially with valid token. After exactly 30 minutes, token expires silently. Next API call to load teams returns 401 Unauthorized. Teams disappear from profile page and everywhere else because frontend likely doesn't handle 401 responses properly. 🛠️ FRONTEND ISSUE: The problem is NOT with backend APIs - they work correctly. The issue is that frontend doesn't detect 401 responses and redirect user to login. Frontend should implement proper 401 error handling and token refresh mechanism. TESTING COMPLETED: 7/7 authentication tests passed, all scenarios verified including valid tokens, expired tokens, invalid tokens, and missing tokens."

ROOT CAUSE OF USER ISSUE FOUND: ✅ Backend authentication system is working perfectly - all endpoints properly validate JWT tokens and return correct HTTP status codes ✅ JWT tokens are correctly configured to expire after exactly 30 minutes (ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES = 30) as defined in auth.py ✅ When tokens expire, backend correctly returns 401 'Could not validate credentials' for all protected endpoints including GET /api/teams ✅ This perfectly matches the user-reported issue: 'User can log in successfully and see teams initially, but after some time (likely 30 minutes due to token expiration), teams disappear from the profile page and everywhere else' 🔍 DETAILED TECHNICAL ANALYSIS: 1) User logs in successfully and receives valid 30-minute JWT token 2) User can see teams initially because token is valid 3) After exactly 30 minutes, token expires silently in background 4) Next API call to load teams (GET /api/teams) returns 401 Unauthorized 5) Teams disappear from profile page and UI because frontend likely doesn't handle 401 responses properly 🛠️ FRONTEND ISSUE IDENTIFIED: The problem is NOT with backend APIs - they work correctly. The issue is that frontend doesn't detect 401 responses and redirect user to login page. Frontend needs to implement proper 401 error handling and token refresh mechanism.
